# Hosting a React App on AWS S3

## Overview
This guide walks you through the steps to host your React application on an AWS S3 bucket, including setting up permissions to avoid the 403 Forbidden error.

## Steps

### 1. Build Your React App
- Navigate to your React project directory (the one containing `src` and `public` folders).
- Build the project using `npm run build`. This will create a `build` directory containing your production-ready React app.

### 2. Upload the Build Folder to S3
- Open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service.
- Select the S3 bucket you've created for hosting.
- Click on the “Upload” button.
- Upload all files and folders from the `build` directory to your S3 bucket.
- Click “Upload” to complete the process.

### 3. Enable Static Website Hosting
- In your S3 bucket, go to the “Properties” tab.
- Scroll down to “Static website hosting” and click “Edit.”
- Enable static website hosting.
  - Set **Index document** to `index.html`.
  - Set **Error document** to `index.html`.
- Save the changes.

### 4. Configure Permissions

#### Bucket Policy
- In the S3 bucket, go to the “Permissions” tab.
- Scroll down to “Bucket Policy” and ensure it allows public access:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      }
    ]
  }
